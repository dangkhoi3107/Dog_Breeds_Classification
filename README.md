# Dog Breeds Classification

This Data Mining project focuses primarily on data exploration and data preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Stanford Dogs Dataset. You can download it from Kaggle:

1. [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
1. [70 Dog Breeds-Image Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set)

### Instructions to Download and Prepare the Dataset

1. Download the dataset from the link above.
2. Place the downloaded ZIP file in the `/data/raw/` directory.

## How to Run

Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Run the `Data_Exploration_1.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset 1 and understand its structure.
   - Run the `Data_Exploration_2.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset 2 and understand its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Run the `Data_Preprocess_1.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the dataset 1. This step includes cleaning, resizing, and normalizing the images.
   - Run the `Data_Preprocess_2.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the dataset 2. This step includes cleaning, resizing, normalizing the images, and also classification

3. **Data Classification:**
   - Run the `Data_Classification_1.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the classification model.
   - Run the `Data_Preprocess_2.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the classification model.

Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebooks. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.
